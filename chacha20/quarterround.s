    # Remember the ABI: we must not destroy the values in r4 to r52.

#  *a = *a + *b;
#  *d = *d ^ *a;
#  *d = rotate(*d, 16);

#  *c = *c + *d;
#  *b = *b ^ *c;

#  *d = *d ^ *a;

#According to conventions, r0 through r3 contain the arguments of the function call (so the addresses of a, b, c and d respectively)
#ARM does not contain a rotate-left instruction, so we simulate using a LSL of X and an LSR of 32-X. 
#NoÃ«l was being stupid, we can just rotate with 32-X instead of doing annoying shifts. Not used to having rotate instructions that are useful
