#According to conventions, r0 through r3 contain the arguments of the function call (so a, b, c and d respectively)
#ARM does not contain a rotate-left instruction, so we simulate using a LSL of X and an LSR of 32-X. 
#NoÃ«l was being stupid, we can just rotate with 32-X instead of doing annoying shifts. Not used to having rotate instructions that are useful
